class BPR:
    """
    Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) for implicit feedback data

    Parameters
    ----------
    learning_rate : float, default 0.01
        learning rate for gradient descent

    n_factors : int, default 20
        Number/dimension of user and item latent factors

    n_iters : int, default 15
        Number of iterations to train the algorithm
        
    batch_size : int, default 1000
        batch size for batch gradient descent, the original paper
        uses stochastic gradient descent (i.e., batch size of 1),
        but this can make the training unstable (very sensitive to
        learning rate)

    reg : int, default 0.01
        Regularization term for the user and item latent factors

    seed : int, default 1234
        Seed for the randomly initialized user, item latent factors

    verbose : bool, default True
        Whether to print progress bar while training

    Attributes
    ----------
    user_factors : 2d ndarray, shape [n_users, n_factors]
        User latent factors learnt

    item_factors : 2d ndarray, shape [n_items, n_factors]
        Item latent factors learnt
